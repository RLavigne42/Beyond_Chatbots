# Epilogue to Part II: Forging an Expert

At the end of Part I, our ACME Assistant was a well-built machine, cleanly engineered and reliable. Now, after the work of Part II, it has become an expert.

We took that solid foundation and enriched it with knowledge and skill. Our assistant is no longer generic. It can reason its way through complex, multi-step problems. It has access to a carefully curated library of your company’s specific knowledge, and it knows how to cite its sources with verifiable proof. Most importantly, it now speaks with a distinct, disciplined voice—a behavioral style you sculpted with a fine-grained LoRA tune.

Through this process, you mastered the core philosophy of modern LLM enrichment: knowledge belongs in the index; behavior belongs in the weights. You learned that the quality of your RAG system is a direct reflection of the quality of your data pipeline, and that fine-tuning is not for memorizing facts, but for shaping personality.

Our assistant is now a formidable specialist. It has graduated from its training with honors.

But so far, its work has been confined to the pristine environment of our lab. It has answered our test queries and accessed our clean data sources. It has not yet faced the chaos of the real world: the unpredictable user, the legacy API, the need to remember a conversation from last Tuesday, or the responsibility of performing an action that cannot be undone.

In Part III, Systems in the Wild, we take our newly-trained expert and put it to work. We will move beyond the core component and integrate it into a living, breathing ecosystem of other systems and real users. We will grant it memory, connect it to live tools, and build the robust operational guardrails that allow it to function safely and effectively in production.

The expert is trained. Now, it's time to open the office doors.
