# Prologue to Part III: Systems in the Wild

At the end of Part II, we forged an expert. Our ACME Assistant, equipped with deep knowledge through RAG and refined skills through fine-tuning, is now a powerful cognitive engine. It can reason, retrieve, and respond with a precision and style that far surpasses the generic model we started with. It is, for all intents and purposes, a highly trained specialist.

But so far, this specialist has worked in a quiet library, answering questions under perfect conditions.

Part III is about giving our expert a real job. We are moving it from the lab into the chaotic, interconnected, and high-stakes environment of a live business—the wild.

Here, the challenges are no longer just about the quality of a single response. They are about continuity, action, and consequence. How does our assistant remember a conversation from last Tuesday? How does it safely use company tools to update a CRM or query a database? How do we connect it to other systems without causing cascading failures? And most importantly, how do we deploy, monitor, and govern this powerful new employee to ensure it is not just effective, but also reliable, secure, and safe?

In this section, we will build the robust operational scaffolding that surrounds the model. We will implement memory, build action-taking agents, integrate with external APIs, and establish the rigorous evaluation, deployment, and security practices that separate a fragile prototype from a resilient, production-grade system.

The expert is trained. It's time to put it to work.
